# Space Image
Author: David Antunez

This program generates the day of the week in which you were born given your birthday and the astrology picture of the day associated with that day. Zeller's congruence 
algorithm is used to calculate the day of the week, and NASA's APOD API is used to retrieve the image for that date.
